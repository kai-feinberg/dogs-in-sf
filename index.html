                <h2>A Ruff Idea</h2>
                <div class="text_div">
                    <p>
                        It was golden hour in Lafayette Park, and every mile of the sprawling 11.5-acre park was
                        littered with dogs. Small groups of people formed in the play area, laughing and talking, while
                        their dogs roamed around.


                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Russ Smith sat on a bench as his German Shepherd Husky mix, Otto, ran ecstatically around the
                        park. Smith fit in perfectly with the scene, happily talking with friends while playing fetch
                        with his dog. Nobody would've been able to tell from a first glance - but Otto changed his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smith had lived in San Francisco for 14 years and, until recently, was working in the tech
                        industry. He felt like his projects “were for things that didn't really improve the world.” He
                        faced a pivotal moment in his life. “I feel like it's tough for people in my age to make new
                        friends,” Smith said.
                    </p>

            <div class="text_div">
                <h2>The Unfurtunate Reality</h2>

                <p>
                    Smith isn't alone in feeling this way. San Francisco has the largest millennial population in the
                    US. The city also doesn't have a large population of children, with the number of dogs living in San
                    Francisco exceeding the number of children, according to data from the American Community Survey.

                </p>

                <p>
                    One factor contributing to this shared feeling of loneliness is the high percentage of people
                    working from home. Compared to other major cities, like New York City, Boston and Chicago, San
                    Francisco has nearly 15% more residents working from home.

                    Because of the high work-from-home rates in the city, San Franciscans lack structured workspace
                    interactions. The pandemic caused a huge shift in everyone's lives, moving a lot of people to work
                    from home. Technologies like Zoom and Google Meet became the norm and still persist today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, mental health issues have only been exacerbated in the past few years by the
                    uncertainty and lack of human connection brought about by the pandemic. Social media has taken
                    face-to-face interactions into asynchronous digital spaces.

                    Mental health struggles and loneliness is not a uniquely SF problem but a generational issue. But
                    oddly
                    enough, being in the center of the tech world and the face of the future, people are lonelier than
                    ever.
                    Technological innovations seem to have distanced people from each other and fostered a culture of
                    dispassion and detachedness. But San Francisco has found a unique way to combat the challenges of
                    the
                    modern day: dogs.

                <p>
                    Pets have become a way to overcome challenges of loneliness and disconnection. At first glance, dog
                    culture in San Francisco may seem superficial, like a city of young people who like dogs and spoil
                    them.

                </p>

                <p>

                    Elisa Tilley, for example, has a two-year-old dog named Millie. She explained that Millie gets bored
                    of food easily. Tilly cooks organic foods including cooked chicken, vegetables and fruits. “I spoil
                    her with everything: snacks, treats, anything. If we go to the store and she loves a toy I buy it
                    for her. I mean, I spend a lot of money on my dog,” Tilley said
                </p>

                <p>
                    In San Francisco, dog-related businesses such as doggie daycares, dog walkers and dog restaurants
                    abound. Dogue, a dog food restaurant, opened in 2015 and recently began offering a $75 tasting menu.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this isn't just a story about spoiled dogs. People get dogs to give them companionship but
                    in many ways they're getting a lot more than that. Dogs have been proven to help improve mental
                    health. They also motivate people to go outside more and interact with others. Even if
                    people can't bring themselves to be social, they want their dogs to take walks and meet other dogs.
                    Communities have formed in these dog parks of dog lovers.

                <p>
                    Smith adopted Otto four years ago. Even though he actively sought to get a dog, he remembers feeling
                    unprepared for having a pet to care for. This led him to buy a bunch of tech toys, which were part
                    of the brand Mars Petcare. Eventually, he was inspired to create activity monitors for pets and was
                    able to test them on Otto. He went on to found Whistle, a piece of AI technology that monitors pet
                    health. When the pandemic hit, it was also incredibly lonely for him.

                    Dogs have helped combat loneliness in the city, and it has extended beyond just pandemic times. In
                    the middle of the pandemic, Nandi Hurley was out walking her dog, Zoey, a 2-year-old German
                    Shepherd. “People are much more friendlier to dogs than humans,” Hurley said. “Everybody that I've
                    met here around this area is because of the dog.”


                    Josh B. was also out with his dog Kona, an Australian Shepherd. He's only lived in San Francisco for
                    six months and works exclusively from home.

                The impact dogs have had on the people of San Francisco is more than just having a furry friend. And
                while there are many different contributing factors to this phenomenon, San Francisco is an
                incredibly dog-friendly city.
                “I would assume that a lot of people love dogs,” said Hurley. “The type of people who are San
                Franciscans are also dog people.”
