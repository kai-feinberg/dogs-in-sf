            <h2>A Ruff Idea</h2>
            <div class="text_div">
                <p>
                    It's golden hour in Lafayette Park, and every mile of the sprawling 11.5 acre park is littered with
                    dogs of all shapes and sizes. Small groups of people form in the play area, laughing and talking,
                    while their dogs roam around.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Russ Smith sits on a bench as his German Shepherd Husky mix named Otto runs ecstatically around the
                    park. He fits in perfectly with the scene, happily talking with friends while playing fetch with his
                    dog. Nobody would've been able to tell from a first glance, but Otto changed his life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Smith has lived in San Francisco for 14 years and works in the tech industry. However, he felt like
                    his projects “were for things that didn't really improve the world.” Besides dissatisfaction with
                    work, he also was facing a pivotal moment in his life. “I feel like it's tough for people in my age
                    to like make new friends,” said Smith.

            <h2>The Unfurtunate Reality</h2>

            <p>
                Smith isn't alone in feeling this way. San Francisco has the largest millennial population in the US.
                The city also doesn't have a large population of children, with the number of dogs living in San
                Francisco exceeding the number of children.
            </p>

            <p>
                One factor contributing to this shared feeling of loneliness is the high percentage of people working
                from home. Compared to other major cities, like New York City, Boston, and Chicago, San Francisco has
                nearly 15% more citizens working from home.

                Due to the high work from home rates in the city, San Franciscans lack the structured workspace
                interactions many others engage in. The pandemic caused a huge shift in everyone's lives, moving a lot
                of people to work from home. Technologies like Zoom and Google Meet became the norm and still persist
                today. However, without the daily in person interactions at work, it can get lonely.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to San
                Francisco, there is an increasing wave of generational struggles. Mental health issues have only been
                exacerbated in the past few years by the pandemic, uncertainty, and lack of human connection. Not to
                mention the explosion of social media which has stolen even more face to face interactions.

                Mental health struggles and loneliness is not a uniquely SF problem but a generational issue. But oddly
                enough, being in the center of the tech world and the face of the future, people are lonelier than ever.
                Technological innovations seem to have distanced people from each other and fostered a culture of
                dispassion and detachedness. But San Francisco has found a unique way to combat the challenges of the
                modern day: dogs.

                Mental health struggles and loneliness is not a uniquely SF problem but a generational issue. But oddly
                enough, being in the center of the tech world and the face of the future, people are lonelier than ever.
                Technological innovations seem to have distanced people from each other and fostered a culture of
                dispassion and detachedness. But San Francisco has found a unique way to combat the challenges of the
                modern day: dogs.

            </p>

            <p>
                Elisa Tilley has a two year old dog named Millie. She explains that Millie gets bored of food really
                easily and she'll cook for her. Millie only eats organic foods including cooked chicken, vegetables, and
                fruits. “I spoil her with everything - snacks, treats, anything. If we go to the store and she loves a
                toy I buy it for her. I mean I spend a lot of money on my dog,” said Tilley.
            </p>

            <p>
                It's not just Tilley though. There is no shortage of dog related businesses in San Francisco like doggie
                daycares, dog walkers, and even dog restaurants. Dogue, a dog food restaurant, opened in 2015 with the
                goal of “feeding fresh, seasonal, quality whole food one meal at a time.” Recently, they began offering
                a $75 tasting menu.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, this isn't just a story about spoiled dogs. People get dogs to give them companionship but in
                many ways they're getting a lot more than that. Dogs have been proven to help improve mental health.
                They also motivate people to go outside more and interact with others. Even if people
                can't bring themselves to be social, they want their dogs to take walks and meet other dogs. Communities
                have formed in these dog parks of dog lovers.

            <p>
                Smith adopted Otto four years ago. Even though he actively sought to get a dog, he remembers feeling
                unprepared for having a pet to care for. This led him to buy a bunch of tech toys which were part of the
                brand Mars Petcare.

                Eventually he was inspired to create activity monitors for pets and was able to test them on Otto. He
                went on to found Whistle, a piece of AI technology that monitors pet health.

                When the pandemic hit, it was also incredibly lonely for him.

                        think he helped a lot with just the sheer loneliness of those three years.”

                Dogs have helped combat loneliness in the city, but it has extended beyond just pandemic times. At the
                time, Nandi Hurley was out walking her dog, Zoey, a 2 year old German Shepherd. “People are much more
                friendlier to dogs than humans,” said Hurley. “Everybody that I've met here around this area is because
                of the dog.” Josh B. was also out with his dog Kona, an Australian Shepherd. He's only lived in San
                Francisco for six months and works exclusively from home.

                <b><u>“All the people I've met so far in my
                        six months of living
                        in
                        SF
                        have all been through my dog,” said Josh</b></u>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The impact dogs have had on the people of San Francisco is more than just having a furry friend. And
                while there are many different contributing factors to this phenomenon, San Francisco is an incredibly
                dog-friendly city. “I would assume that a lot of people love dogs. There are a lot of people who don't
                have children. They're single, they don't have children… that's also because of COVID, there are lots of
                people who got dogs but it is dog friendly,” said Hurley. “So maybe the type of people who are San
                Francisco people are also dog people.”
