                <div class="text_div">
                    <p>
                        It's golden hour in Lafayette Park, and every mile of the sprawling 11.5 acre park is littered
                        with
                        dogs of all shapes and sizes. Small groups of people form in the play area, laughing and
                        talking,
                        while their dogs roam around.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Russ Smith sits on a bench as his German Shepherd Husky mix named Otto runs ecstatically around
                        the
                        park. He fits in perfectly with the scene, happily talking with friends while playing fetch with
                        his
                        dog. Nobody would've been able to tell from a first glance, but Otto changed his life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Smith has lived in San Francisco for 14 years and works in the tech industry. However, he felt
                        like
                        his projects “were for things that didn't really improve the world.” Besides dissatisfaction
                        with
                        work, he also was facing a pivotal moment in his life. “I feel like it's tough for people in my
                        age
                        to like make new friends,” said Smith.

                <h2>The Unfurtunate Reality</h2>

                <p>
                    Smith isn't alone in feeling this way. San Francisco has the largest millennial population in the
                    US.
                    The city also doesn't have a large population of children, with the number of dogs living in San
                    Francisco exceeding the number of children.
                </p>

                <p>
                    One factor contributing to this shared feeling of loneliness is the high percentage of people
                    working
                    from home. Compared to other major cities, like New York City, Boston, and Chicago, San Francisco
                    has
                    nearly 15% more citizens working from home.

                    Due to the high work from home rates in the city, San Franciscans lack the structured workspace
                    interactions many others engage in. The pandemic caused a huge shift in everyone's lives, moving a
                    lot
                    of people to work from home. Technologies like Zoom and Google Meet became the norm and still
                    persist
                    today. However, without the daily in person interactions at work, it can get lonely.

                    In addition to San
                    Francisco, there is an increasing wave of generational struggles. Mental health issues have only
                    been
                    exacerbated in the past few years by the pandemic, uncertainty, and lack of human connection. Not to
                    mention the explosion of social media which has stolen even more face to face interactions.

                    Mental health struggles and loneliness is not a uniquely SF problem but a generational issue. But
                    oddly
                    enough, being in the center of the tech world and the face of the future, people are lonelier than

                    Technological innovations seem to have distanced people from each other and fostered a culture of

                    Elisa Tilley has a two year old dog named Millie. She explains that Millie gets bored of food really
                    easily and she'll cook for her. Millie only eats organic foods including cooked chicken, vegetables,
                    and
                    fruits. “I spoil her with everything - snacks, treats, anything. If we go to the store and she loves
                    a
                    toy I buy it for her. I mean I spend a lot of money on my dog,” said Tilley.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It's not just Tilley though. There is no shortage of dog related businesses in San Francisco like
                    doggie
                    daycares, dog walkers, and even dog restaurants. Dogue, a dog food restaurant, opened in 2015 with
                    the
                    goal of “feeding fresh, seasonal, quality whole food one meal at a time.” Recently, they began
                    offering
                    a $75 tasting menu.
                </p>

                <p>
                    However, this isn't just a story about spoiled dogs. People get dogs to give them companionship but
                    in
                    many ways they're getting a lot more than that. Dogs have been proven to help improve mental health.
                    They also motivate people to go outside more and interact with others. Even if people
                    can't bring themselves to be social, they want their dogs to take walks and meet other dogs.
                    Communities
                    have formed in these dog parks of dog lovers.

                    Smith adopted Otto four years ago. Even though he actively sought to get a dog, he remembers feeling
                    unprepared for having a pet to care for. This led him to buy a bunch of tech toys which were part of
                    the
                    brand Mars Petcare.

                    Eventually he was inspired to create activity monitors for pets and was able to test them on Otto.
                    He
                    went on to found Whistle, a piece of AI technology that monitors pet health.

                    When the pandemic hit, it was also incredibly lonely for him.

                    Dogs have helped combat loneliness in the city, but it has extended beyond just pandemic times. At
                    the
                    time, Nandi Hurley was out walking her dog, Zoey, a 2 year old German Shepherd. “People are much
                    more
                    friendlier to dogs than humans,” said Hurley. “Everybody that I've met here around this area is
                    because
                    of the dog.” Josh B. was also out with his dog Kona, an Australian Shepherd. He's only lived in San
                    Francisco for six months and works exclusively from home.

                    <b><u>“All the people I've met so far in my
                            six months of living
                            in
                            SF
                            have all been through my dog,” said Josh</b></u>.

                    The impact dogs have had on the people of San Francisco is more than just having a furry friend. And
                    while there are many different contributing factors to this phenomenon, San Francisco is an
                    incredibly
                    dog-friendly city. “I would assume that a lot of people love dogs. There are a lot of people who
                    don't
                    have children. They're single, they don't have children… that's also because of COVID, there are
                    lots of
                    people who got dogs but it is dog friendly,” said Hurley. “So maybe the type of people who are San
                    Francisco people are also dog people.”
