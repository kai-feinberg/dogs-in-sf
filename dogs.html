                    Hysteresis is the dependence of the state of a system on its history. For example, a magnet may have
                    more than one possible magnetic moment in a given magnetic field, depending on how the field changed
                    in the past. Plots of a single component of the moment often form a loop or hysteresis curve, where
                    there are different values of one variable depending on the direction of change of another variable.
                    This history dependence is the basis of memory in a hard disk drive and the remanence that retains a
                    record of the Earth's magnetic field magnitude in the past.

                <p>Hysteresis occurs in ferromagnetic and ferroelectric materials, as well as in the deformation of
                    rubber bands and shape-memory alloys and many other natural phenomena. In natural systems it is
                    often associated with irreversible thermodynamic change such as phase transitions and with internal
                    friction; and dissipation is a common side effect.
                    Hysteresis can be found in physics, chemistry, engineering, biology, and economics. It is
                    incorporated in many artificial systems: for example, in thermostats and Schmitt triggers, it
                    prevents unwanted frequent switching.
                    Hysteresis can be a dynamic lag between an input and an output that dis
